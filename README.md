The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle. It contains information on various products and their sales across different Big Mart outlets. The key features include:

Item Identifier

Item Weight

Item Fat Content

Item Visibility

Item Type

Item MRP

Outlet Identifier

Outlet Establishment Year

Outlet Size

Outlet Location Type

Outlet Type

Item Outlet Sales (target variable)

# Technologies
Python: Programming language Streamlit: Framework for building the web app Scikit-learn: Machine learning library Pandas: Data manipulation library NumPy: Numerical computing library Matplotlib/Seaborn: Data visualization libraries


# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA phase involves analyzing the dataset to uncover patterns, anomalies, and relationships between variables. Key steps include:

Data cleaning

Handling missing values

Feature engineering

Data visualization

# Modeling
We experiment with various machine learning algorithms to predict sales, including:

XGBoost

Decision Trees

Random Forest

# Evaluation
The models are evaluated using metrics such as:
R-squared = 0.5547040460048651

The graphical representation is also shown

# Results
The results section highlights the performance of different models and compares their accuracy. Visualizations and charts are used to illustrate the findings.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to predict sales for Big Mart outlets. The insights gained can help in making informed business decisions, optimizing inventory, and improving sales strategies.
